# VAS-An_AI_Recruiter
VAS - Virtual Applicant Selector is an AI/ML based project (an online website) which aims to provide best shortlisted applicants to the companies.
We all know a company and an applicant go hand in hand. They need each other to fulfill their respective dreams. But nowadays, looking for a best company that can fulfil your desires as well as receiving best applicants for their organization is a challenging task for applicants and companies respectively. To overcome this situation, we bring an online website that connects different companies and the applicants together.
### Description
Shortlisting of the applicants for the companies is a three step process:
  1. CV/Resume Analysis - It analyses the CV/Resume of the applicant and marks them accordingly. This is achieved through Machine Learning Algorithms
  2. Performance in two Online Tests - Grabs the mental ability and technical skills of the applicant
  3. AI Interview - Our InterviewBot screens the applicant completely and predict the traits/skills which the applicant may possess
### Prerequisites
1. Any operating system
2. Make sure you have python installed on your device
3. Create an account in IBM cloudant and paste the credentials in app.py line 15
4. Also create 5 partitioned databases in the cloudant for users, jobs, aptitude questions, technical questions and interview questions
5. Create a new folder and open its directory in the command prompt
6. Run -> pip install virtualenv (This is preferred to create a separate environment where you don't need root privileges)
7. Run -> virtualenv venv and activate the directory
8. Run -> pip install -r requirements.txt (This is to install the dependencies required for this project)
